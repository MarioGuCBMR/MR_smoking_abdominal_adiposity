## README of code for curation of exposure data:

Here is the code for the treatment of each of the exposure:

Smoking Initiation: the conditionally independent dataframe downloadable from Supplementary Table X was used instead because it contained individuals from 23andME. Hence, no curation was needed
Cigarettes per Day (past and current smokers): the conditionally independent dataframe downloadable from Supplementary Table X was used instead because it contained individuals from 23andME. Hence no curation was needed.
Cigarettes per Day (current smokers): Curating_cigarettes_current_VCF.R
Lifetime smoking: Curating_lifetime.R
Pack-years: Curating_packs_per_year_VCF.R
